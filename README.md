# Genetic-Algorithm-for-Chessboard-Placement
- The aim of this work is to create a program which allows placing different types of pieces on a chess board of 8 Ã— 8 cells using a Genetic Algorithm.
Thus, the goal is to f i nd a placement that minimizes conflicts between the pieces (In the optimal scenario, there is no conflict). Each piece type has specific movement constraints, and the objective is to find an arrangement minimizing conflicts (Minimize the number of threatening pieces). The considered pieces are : 4 queens , 2 rooks , 2 bishops , 2 knight.
