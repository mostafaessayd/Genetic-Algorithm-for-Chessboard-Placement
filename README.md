# Genetic-Algorithm-for-Chessboard-Placement
-The aim of this work is to create a program which allows placing dif f erent types of pieces on a chess board of 8 Ã— 8 cells using a Genetic Algorithm.
Thus, the goal is to f i nd a placement that minimizes conf l icts between the pieces (In the optimal scenario, there is no conf l ict). Each piece type has specif i c movement constraints, and the objective is to f i nd an arrangement minimizing conf l icts (Minimize the number of threatening pieces). The considered pieces are : 4 queens , 2 rooks , 2 bishops , 2 knight.
